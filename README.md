    Performance Metrics: Created metrics to evaluate the success of various genres and artists in the store.
Technologies Used
    SQL (MySQL) for data querying and analysis.
    Concepts such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), aggregate functions, and window functions to facilitate complex queries.
Data Sources
    The project uses a music store database containing tables such as customer, invoice, track, album, and genre etc 

Conclusion
